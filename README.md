# DFIQ (Digital Forensics Investigative Questions)

DFIQ is fundamentally a collection of investigative questions and the various
approaches to answering those questions. The purpose of DFIQ is to drive
consistent, thorough, and explainable investigations. It aims to do this by:
- Deconstructing large, ambiguous, open-ended questions into multiple smaller,
  well-defined ones
- Creating and maintaining an ever-evolving catalog of investigative knowledge
  ("Questions" and "Approaches" to answer them)
- Building investigation plans ("Scenarios") for frequent case types, providing
- a common starting point for similar cases
